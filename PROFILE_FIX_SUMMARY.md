# Profile Page Issues - Fix Summary

## Issues Identified:
1. âœ… **Avatar URL field removed** - No longer showing in the form
2. âœ… **Profile data loading debugging** - Added console logs to track data flow
3. ðŸ”§ **RLS infinite recursion** - Needs database fix
4. ðŸ”§ **Data not showing in form** - Related to RLS issue

## Fixes Applied:

### 1. Profile.jsx Updates âœ…
- Removed `avatar_url` from form state and form fields
- Removed `avatar_url` from database update query  
- Added detailed console logging to debug data flow
- Fixed JSX structure errors

### 2. Database RLS Issue ðŸ”§
**CRITICAL: You need to run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor:**

```sql
-- Fix RLS infinite recursion
-- Run this in Supabase SQL Editor (not in VS Code)

-- First, temporarily disable RLS to avoid recursion
ALTER TABLE public.users DISABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Drop all existing conflicting policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON public.users;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.users;

-- Re-enable RLS
ALTER TABLE public.users ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

-- Create simple, non-recursive policies
CREATE POLICY "users_select_own" ON public.users
    FOR SELECT USING (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "users_insert_own" ON public.users
    FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (id = auth.uid());

CREATE POLICY "users_update_own" ON public.users
    FOR UPDATE USING (id = auth.uid());

-- Verify the fix works
SELECT id, email, username, full_name, role FROM users WHERE id = auth.uid();
```

## Testing Steps:

### After applying the SQL fix:
1. Open http://localhost:5174
2. Sign in to your account
3. Go to Profile page
4. Check browser console for debug logs:
   - Should see "Profile useEffect triggered" with profile data
   - Should see form being populated with user data
5. Try filling in missing name/username and saving
6. Should save successfully without "infinite recursion" error

## Expected Behavior:
- Profile page loads with email pre-filled (read-only)
- Full name and username fields should auto-populate from database
- Social links should auto-populate if previously saved
- Avatar URL field is completely removed
- Save button works without recursion errors

## Debug Console Messages:
Look for these in browser console:
```
Profile useEffect triggered, profile: {id, email, username, full_name, ...}
User: {id, email, ...}
Setting form data with profile: {...}
```

If you see "No profile data available", the RLS fix above should resolve it.
